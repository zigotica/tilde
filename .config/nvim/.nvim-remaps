" ----------- shortcomings
" mac os doesnt expose the Alt or Ctrl combinations properly to vim
" To determine whether Vim receives a key sequence, do the following: 
" in INSERT mode press <CTRL-V> followed by the key sequence
" Alternatively, we can use this in the terminal
" then type the desired combination
" sed -n l
" In out case, Alt + arrows are: 
" Right ^[[C 
" Up ^[[A 
" Left ^[[D 
" Down ^[[B
" Shift + arrows are:
" Left  ^[[1;2D 
" Right ^[[1;2C
" In theory adding these to mappings should work, replacing ^[ by <Esc>
" BUT THEY DONT WORK 
"
" Best option for this to work on a Mac using the normal A- or M- modifiers  
" WOULD BE to (check) Use Option as Meta Key in Terminal->Preferences->Keyboard
" BUT PROBLEM with this, it stops allowing special chars in terminal (ie AltGr + 1 for |)
"
" Also can review the keyboard mappings in Terminal->Preferences->Keyboard. In my case:
" Alt + arrows are: 
" Left \033b
" Right \033f
" So I also removed these
" 
" So, apparently, there is no way to make arrows work as remaps using a modifier
" Final solution is to map it to Function keys
